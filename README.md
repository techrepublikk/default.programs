# Default Programs

[![Default Programs](light-neon.png)](https://github.com/techrepublikk/default.programs)

Use Default Programs to set the default user experience. Users can access Default Programs from Control Panel or directly from the Start menu. Set Program Access and Computer Defaults (SPAD) tool, the primary defaults experience for users in Windows XP, is now one part of Default Programs.

When a user sets program defaults using Default Programs, the default setting applies only to that user and not to other users who might use the same computer. Default Programs provides a set of APIs (deprecated in Windows 8) that enable independent software vendors (ISVs) to include their programs or applications in the defaults system. The API set also helps ISVs better manage their status as defaults.
